By 2030, an estimated 575 million people will still live in extreme poverty, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and conflict zones. Despite some expansion in social protection, over 4 billion lack adequate coverage. Historical trends indicate limited progress in halving national poverty rates by 2030, with insufficient social protection for vulnerable groups. Addressing poverty requires increased action and investment in job creation and social services, prioritizing essential services with redirected public resources.</p>

Despite global efforts, projections suggest that by 2030, approximately 670 million people will still face hunger, equal to the number in 2015. Challenges persist in reducing malnutrition among children, necessitating a 2.2-fold increase in the current rate of reduction in stunting to meet global targets.

Notably, there's an alarming increase in the number of un- or under-vaccinated children, especially in low- and middle-income countries, alongside a slow decline in maternal mortality rates and under-5 mortality rates, with urgent efforts required to meet the 2030 targets. Progress towards ending communicable diseases remains off track, with setbacks observed in reducing HIV infections, TB, and malaria cases. Additionally, there's a need to bolster health systems and address the shortage of health workers, especially in regions with high disease burdens.</p>

Without additional measures, only a small fraction of countries will meet Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG4) by 2030, leaving millions of children without access to quality education and lacking essential numeracy and literacy skills. Despite some improvements in school completion rates, progress has slowed, and learning levels have stagnated, with documented losses due to pandemic-related school closures. Access to pre-primary education remains limited, and participation in education and training for youth and adults is insufficient.</p>

Progress in closing gender gaps in various areas, such as legal protection, representation in leadership roles, and ending child marriage, remains slow, with estimations suggesting it could take centuries to achieve parity. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing gender inequalities, particularly in healthcare, education, and economic opportunities. Comprehensive policy reforms and strong political leadership are deemed essential to dismantle systemic barriers to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG5) and advancing gender equality globally.</p>

Achieving universal coverage by 2030 requires substantial increases in current rates of progress, particularly for drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene. Challenges include water pollution, wastewater treatment, and water use efficiency, compounded by inadequate frameworks for sustainable water management and decreasing ODA disbursements to the water sector. Addressing these issues necessitates boosting infrastructure investment, enhancing cross-sectoral coordination, and prioritizing climate change adaptation efforts to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG6).
